            <h2>COVID-19 GUIDELINES AND EXPECTATIONS</h2>
            <span>​
                - Proof of full vaccination (both hard and digital copies are accepted), or a negative COVID-19 test
                within 48 hours of your appointment, is required before entering the studio.
                <br>
                <br>
                - You ensure that you, and everyone in your household, are in good health with no symptoms of COVID-19
                (as listed at <a
                    href="https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/symptoms-and-testing/">https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/symptoms-and-testing/</a>).
                If you are experiencing symptoms of any other illness (i.e. common cold, etc.) please let me know as
                soon as possible so we can reschedule so you can heal and I remain healthy.
                <br>
                <br>
                - Please arrive wearing a clean non-surgical mask. You will be required to wear this mask during your
                entire appointment. Your mask must have a minimum of two layers and can be store bought or homemade.
                Bandanas, scarves, and paper masks do not count. If you do not have a mask I will have them available
                for a fee (please note wearing a mask is mandatory when entering the building to the studio). I will
                also be wearing a new disposable mask for each client that will remain on for the entirety of our
                session.
                <br>
                <br>
                - Only you (the client) and I (the artist) are permitted in the studio procedure area. It is a small
                space, so guests are not permitted within the procedure area. If someone is picking you up after your
                appointment they may wait in the building’s lobby while wearing a mask.
                <br>
                <br>
                - Once inside you will be asked to wash or sanitize your hands before sitting down.
                <br>
                <br>
                - Aftercare instructions will be sent via email. You may also take a picture of the laminated copy in
                the studio.
                <br>
                <br>
                - Cash is still my preferred method of payment, but e-Transfers will be available if handling cash is
                uncomfortable. If paying with cash please bring multiple/smaller bills as no change can be given at this
                time.
                <br>
                <br>
                - No outside food or drink (i.e. fast food, Tim Hortons, Starbucks, etc.). If you’d like to bring a
                water bottle or snack for break-time, please bring it in one (1) closed bag or purse. You will be asked
                to step outside the procedure area to take off your mask to eat or drink and will only be permitted back
                inside when wearing the mask again.
                <br>
                <br>
                Thanks for your understanding and cooperation during this time of transition!
