                Hi!
                <br>
                <br>
                Welcome to this disclaimer and info page for December 2022 and January 2023 tattoo bookings.
                <br>
                <br>
                Please <strong><a onclick="navigateTo('faq')">carefully read the Booking FAQ</a></strong> before filling
                out this form!
                <br>
                <br>
                Only those whose projects are selected will be contacted. I will post to my main instagram grid when I
                am done contacting folks. You will get a confirmation email saying your form has been received, so no
                need to check in!
                You can list up to 3 designs you'd like to book in for, this can be a mix of flash and custom ideas. If
                you wish to customize a flash design please say HOW, just stating you want it to be changed does not
                give me the information to know if the customization is within my skill set.
                <br>
                <br>
                Take your time and fill the whole form out! Missing information may lead to your request not being
                accepted.
                Please attach a photo of your desired placement if you have other close tattoos so we can make sure
                there is a seamless fit.
                <br>
                <br>
                This booking form is the ONLY way to book with me, no direct emails and no DMs, always. If the form is
                NOT UP I am not taking appointments. DMs will not be opened and emails asking for appointments will be
                ignored.
                <br>
                <br>
                With all this said, <a href="https://form.jotform.com/223125267212244">the link is now LIVE</a> for 48 hours until 2pm
                on Wednesday November 16th.
